PostegreSQL is one of the oldest Structured Query Languages

My favorite way to implement databases is using a containerization software, like docker. This makes it easy to start and stop the database engine and quickly move data and easily keep an eye on what background processes are running. 

PostgreSQL has an [official docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
